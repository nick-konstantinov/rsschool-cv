### Summary

I am a beginner frontend developer. My first exposure to front-end came from a desire to help my father. It was needed to create landing page. After studying the basics of HTML/CSS in a few evenings, I developed my first page according to my layout. I used standard notepad as an editor (lol). I was really inspired by this feeling when you create something new by yourself.  
At the moment, my goal is to become a successful frontend developer who can handle complex tasks on different projects. To do this, I continue studying hard and every day I either learn something new or hone old knowledge in practice.
